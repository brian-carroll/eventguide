Event Guide with related content for each event

- Search for gigs/events using TicketMaster API (and later other sources)
- Find content for each "attraction" (e.g. band) from YouTube, Spotify, etc.

Architecture:
------------
Mainly a front-end SPA using Elm
Elm grabs data from the TicketMaster API

Future ideas for back-end:
Help with matching content to events
Provide admin UI for quality control of matching
Pre-compute combinations of different data sources
